# Data Structure and Algorithm: Bank-Management-System-Using-Data-Structures

The Bank Management System is a mini project created by me in 2017.
This is a simple project written in the "C" language with data structures such as hash tables, linked lists and stacks. 
It has some simple and intuitive instructions. It prompts users to create an account or log in at the beginning.
It allows the user to create a new account and also generates a personalized account number. 
The user can log in with the generated account number and his own password, which is hashed for security purposes.
Many operations can be carried out, such as withdrawing money and depositing money.
The user can view the latest transaction and the balance.
After the user has completed the work, a log-out option is provided for safety purposes.

## Startup:
1) Install the gcc compiler on windows or linux. (Preferably Linux)
2) Check for the gcc version to ensure that it is successfully installed. (Run cmd: gcc -v) 
3) Go to the directory using the command prompt where the "bank1.c" is stored using the cmd: cd Desktop/....
4) Then compile the source code, Run command:  gcc bank1.c
5) Final Command: gcc -o bank1 bank1.c
