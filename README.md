# Bank-Management-System-Using-Data-Structures
Bank management system is a DS mini project that was created by me in 2017.
This is a simple program written in "C" language using Data Structures like Hash Tables, linked list and stack. 
It has some simple and intutive instructions. It prompts the users for creating an account or login at the start.
It allows user to create a new account and also generates an personalized account number. 
The user can login using the generated account number and his own password which is hashed for security purposes.
A number of operations can be performed such as withdrawing of money and depositing money.
The user can view the latest transaction and the balance amount.
After the user is done with the work, a logout option is provided for safety purpose.
To run this project:
i) Install the gcc compiler on windows or linux. (Preferably Linux)
ii) Check for the gcc version to ensure that it is successfully installed. ( Run cmd: gcc -v) 
iii) Go to the directory using the command prompt where the "bank1.c" is stored using the cmd: cd Desktop/....
iv) Then compile the source code, Run command:  gcc bank1.c
v) Final Command: gcc -o bank1 bank1.c
